## Features
- [ ] Member-specific task ordering/pinning
- [ ] Task comments or notes section
- [ ] User-facing notifications (e.g., "You have a new task")
- [ ] "Vacation mode" for members to pause task assignments

## Architecture & Refactoring
- [ ] **(Future)** Fully decouple plugin migrations. Investigate creating custom Rake tasks to allow plugins to manage their own schema and data migrations from within their own directory (`plugins/admin/db/migrate`).
- [ ] **(Future)** Fully decouple plugin tests. Configure RSpec to discover and run tests from within each plugin's directory (`plugins/admin/spec/`) in addition to the main `spec/` folder.
- [ ] **(Future)** Fully decouple plugin seeding. Create a mechanism for plugins to register their own seed tasks that can be called by the main `db:seed` Rake task.
- [ ] Evaluate replacing the custom data migration system with a more robust, existing gem if the need arises.

## User's New Feature and Improvement List

### üõ†Ô∏è Core Improvements & Refactors
**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: High

#### Admin System Overhaul
- Replace the current admin model with member-based admin privileges:
  - Members can have optional PINs or passwords.
  - Admin privileges are granted to members (no separate admin model).
  - A default admin member is created in each environment with a default PIN/password (e.g., 0000 or "password").
  - Admin login becomes a simplified landing page showing only admin members, where PIN/password is required for access.
  - Admin login state is isolated: admin members are logged out when leaving the admin area to prevent accidental misuse.
- Redesign the admin area for improved usability and appearance.
- Replace all admin functionality to work with the new member-admin model.

#### Member Management
- Add the ability to pause/unpause members or set them as active/away:
  - Inactive/away time is not counted toward performance or leaderboard.
  - XP/points can be adjusted based on activity percentage (e.g., double XP for 50% activity).
- Optionally allow non-admins to create member profiles (feature flag, already implemented).
- Add optional PIN/password to member profiles for secure access.

#### Task & Board Enhancements
- Allow setting a completion percentage when completing a task (e.g., "folded half the laundry").
- Order task templates alphabetically in member boards, with the generic task always at the bottom.
- Group task templates by category in member boards:
  - Display one entry per category, expandable to show templates within.
  - Simplify task template cards to show less information; clicking a card assigns the task to the member.
  - Admins should still be able to assign tasks to others easily from this view.

#### Testing & Quality
- Fix all pending and skipped tests to ensure full test coverage and reliability.

### üìù Project Tooling
**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: Medium

#### Cursor AI Rules
- Create and document Cursor rules for this project to guide AI assistance and code reviews.
